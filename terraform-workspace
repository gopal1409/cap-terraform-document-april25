##first lets delete the infrastructure we created earlier 
catp-terraform-manifest-may-25
terraform destroy 
###then do git 
git pull
git stash
git pull
##modify the ec2 variables files 
 vi ec2-varaibles.tf
#change the name from gopal to your instance int he instance_tag
###once done now if i do terraform apply 
#lets first check all the workspace 
root@ip-172-31-28-62:~/catp-terraform-manifest-may-25# terraform workspace list
* default
##you can see the default workspace 
root@ip-172-31-28-62:~/catp-terraform-manifest-may-25# terraform apply
'###if you look into the instance tag which is the combination of your default workspace
 + tags                                 = {
          + "Name" = "gopal-ec2-default"
        }
      + tags_all                             = {
          + "Name" = "gopal-ec2-default"
        }

###lets create the resource once create lets create a new workspace called as test 
root@ip-172-31-28-62:~/catp-terraform-manifest-may-25# terraform workspace new test
Created and switched to workspace "test"!

You're now on a new, empty workspace. Workspaces isolate their state,
so if you run "terraform plan" Terraform will not see any existing state
for this configuration.
#####if you check the new workspace the pointer is in test workspace 
root@ip-172-31-28-62:~/catp-terraform-manifest-may-25# terraform workspace list
  default
* test
##lets apply it and see that similar infra it will create or not 
terraform apply
###if you look into the tag 
  + tags                                 = {
          + "Name" = "gopal-ec2-test"
        }
      + tags_all                             = {
          + "Name" = "gopal-ec2-test"
##lets apply it
#once applied go to aws console check for your instance using the search bar you will see there are two instance created one is default another is test 
####go to the s3 bucket and see there are two differnet manifest file also 
#once you verify both the instance 
lets see how to terminate those instances 
217  terraform workspace list
#this will show that you are in test workspace as the * is pointing 
terraform destroy
##once destroyed go to the aws console and check the instance with test as tag is deleted 
#lets delete the instance from the default workspace also 
  terraform workspace list
  219  terraform workspace select default
##this will delete the instance from the default workspace
  220  terraform destroy --auto-approve
##kindly go to aws console and verify the same
